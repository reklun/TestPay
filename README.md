4. Company ID are unique.
5. PAN are unique.

7. Files are complete with data in right format and values, especially for ENUM tapType and StopID.
8. Assume the records come in a correct time sequence. Not sure if this is a valid assumption. If the records dont come 
   in the right order, the pairing logic needs to be enhanced.
